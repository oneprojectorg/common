# `@op/db` Workspace

This workspace defines the database schema, manages migrations, and provides the database client for the application using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with a PostgreSQL database, hosted and managed via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Purpose

To provide a single source of truth for the database structure and a typed client for interacting with the database from other services and applications within the monorepo.

## Structure

- **`schema/`**: Contains the Drizzle schema definitions, defining tables, columns, relations, and types.
  - `publicTables.ts`: Exports tables intended for direct migration generation by `drizzle-kit`.
  - `internalTables.ts`: Exports tables potentially used internally but not directly included in auto-generated migrations.
  - `index.ts`: Exports all schema components (from both `publicTables` and `internalTables`) for use by the Drizzle client (`./client.ts`).
  - `tables/`: Contains the actual SQL table definitions (e.g., `profiles.sql`).
- **`migrations/`**: Stores the SQL migration files generated by `drizzle-kit` (excluding index definitions).
- **`customMigrations/`**: Stores custom SQL files, primarily containing `CREATE INDEX` statements extracted from the main migrations by the `extractIndexes.ts` script. These are applied separately by `migrate.ts`.
- **`client.ts`**: Exports the configured Drizzle database client instance, using schemas from `schema/index.ts`.
- **`tables.ts`**: Exports a helper object `tables` containing only the `PgTable` instances from the combined schema, useful for direct table access.
- **`migrate.ts`**: Script executed to apply database migrations. It first runs standard migrations from `migrations/` using Drizzle's migrator, then executes SQL statements from `customMigrations/` individually (outside transactions). It targets the local development database by default and includes checks to prevent accidental production runs.
- **`seed.ts`**: Script to populate the database with initial or test data.
- **`scripts/extractIndexes.ts`**: A custom script that reads generated migration files in `migrations/`, moves any `CREATE INDEX` statements to `customMigrations/0000_CUSTOM_indexes.sql`, and removes them from the original migration files.
- **`drizzle.config.ts`**: Configuration file for `drizzle-kit`, specifying `schema/publicTables.ts` as the input for migration generation.

Key exports (`client`, `schema`, `tables`) are defined in `package.json`.

## Key Technologies

- **Drizzle ORM**: TypeScript ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: The underlying relational database (hosted on Supabase).
- **postgres**: Node.js PostgreSQL client library used by Drizzle.
- **Supabase**: Used for database hosting, storage (buckets created in `migrate.ts`), and provides CLI tools (`supabase`) for local development workflows (start, stop, reset, status).
- **drizzle-kit**: CLI tool for managing Drizzle schemas and generating migrations based on `schema/publicTables.ts`.
- **tsx**: For running TypeScript files directly (used in migration and seeding scripts).
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables (database connection strings from `.env.local`).

## Relationship to Other Workspaces

**Depends On:**

- **`@op/core`**: For configuration or shared types, specifically `adminEmails` used in `seed.ts`.
- **`@op/eslint-config` (Dev)**: Used for linting configuration during development.
- **`@op/typescript-config` (Dev)**: Used for TypeScript configuration during development.

**Depended On By:**

- **`@op/trpc`**: Uses the DB client and schema for API procedures.

## Development & Workflow

- **Local Database**: Use `pnpm start` (runs `supabase start`) to spin up the local Supabase development environment.
- **Schema Changes**: Modify files in `schema/tables/*.sql` and update exports in `schema/publicTables.ts` or `schema/internalTables.ts`.
- **Generate Migrations**: Run `pnpm generate` after schema changes. This runs `drizzle-kit generate` (based on `publicTables.ts`) and the custom `extractIndexes.ts` script (which moves index statements to `customMigrations/`).
- **Apply Migrations**: Run `pnpm migrate` to apply pending migrations from `migrations/` and `customMigrations/` to the configured database (local development database by default).
- **View Schema**: Use `pnpm studio` (runs `drizzle-kit studio`) to browse the schema visually.
- **Seeding**: Run `pnpm seed` to populate the database.
- **Reset Local DB**: Use `pnpm reset` (runs `supabase db reset`) to completely reset the local Supabase database.
- **Lint**: Run `pnpm lint`.
