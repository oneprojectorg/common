/**
 * Drizzle Relations v2 definitions
 *
 * Single source of truth for v2 relational query relations.
 * Relations are defined here using `defineRelations`.
 *
 * Note: v1 relations still exist in individual *.sql.ts files for `db._query`.
 * This file is for the new `db.query` API.
 *
 * Why not colocate with tables?
 * =============================
 * We attempted to use `defineRelationsPart` to colocate relations with their
 * tables, but this approach has a critical limitation: nested relation types
 * are not properly inferred when spreading parts together. For example, if
 * you query `proposals.submittedBy.avatarImage`, TypeScript can't infer the
 * full `ObjectsInStorage` type because the `profiles.avatarImage` relation
 * is defined in a separate part that TypeScript doesn't connect.
 *
 * Using a single `defineRelations` call ensures all relations are typed
 * together, enabling proper nested type inference.
 *
 * @see https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/relations-v1-v2
