        </Header3>
        <p>
          One Project is focused on connecting people, organizations, and
          resources to coordinate and scale a global democratic economy. All
          users of the Platform must comply with our Code of Conduct, available
          here, including these core community principles:
        </p>

        <Header3 className="font-serif text-sm">
          4.1 Treat Everyone with Respect and Consideration
        </Header3>
        <p>
          (adopted from DisCO Caring Community Guidelines): Be kind,
          understanding, and compassionate to each other. Be welcoming. Be aware
          of how we use language. This is especially important when discussing
          sensitive topics where misunderstandings and stereotypes can be
          exacerbated. Remember we're here to support, learn, and collaborate
          with each other to grow a democratic economy.
        </p>

        <Header3 className="font-serif text-sm">
          4.2 Be Respectful of Privacy
        </Header3>
        <p>
          Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. If there are
          sensitive partnerships, obtain permission before making them visible
          on the Platform.
        </p>

        <Header3 className="font-serif text-sm">
          4.3 Build Robust Relationships
        </Header3>
        <p>
          Build strong, resilient connections that strengthen collaboration,
          deepen existing partnerships, and enable new relationships to emerge.
        </p>

        <Header3 className="font-serif text-sm">
          4.4 Inclusive Network Development
        </Header3>
        <p>
          Wherever possible, try to amplify the voice and needs of smaller local
          organizations that may initially have limited connections as they
          start to engage new collaborations on the Platform.
        </p>

        <Header3 className="font-serif text-sm">
          4.5 Center Affected Communities
        </Header3>
        <p>
          (adopted from New Economy Coalition Agreements): Recognize and respect
          the expertise, leadership, and lived experiences of communities most
          impacted by economic inequality. Actively make space for their voices,
          defer to their guidance on issues affecting them directly, and
          acknowledge their essential role in developing meaningful solutions.
        </p>

        <Header3 className="font-serif text-sm">
          4.6 Share from Your Own Experiences
        </Header3>
        <p>
          (adopted from New Economy Coalition Agreements): Be sure to share
          information and perspectives from your experiences rather than making
          assumptions about or speaking on behalf of others. When sharing
          information, clearly distinguish among personal knowledge,
          organizational position/perspective, and third-party information.

          OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH

        <p>
          You hereby agree that any claim or dispute between you and One
          Project, whether brought by you or by One Project, arising out of or
          relating in any way to these Terms of Service or your use of the
          Services must be resolved through final, binding arbitration, except
          that either you or we may assert claims in small claims court if those
          claims qualify under applicable Law. In addition, either you or we
          have the option to bring claims in court to enjoin infringement or
          other violation of intellectual property rights without seeking
          damages. This arbitration obligation applies regardless of whether the
          claim or dispute involves a warranty, tort, fraud, misrepresentation,
          product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other
          legal theory. Unless you opt-out of arbitration as set forth below,
          the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court, will have
          exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
          interpretation, applicability, scope, unconscionability,
          arbitrability, enforceability or formation of this arbitration
          provision, including any claim that all or any part of this
          arbitration provision is void or voidable. There is no judge or jury
          in arbitration, the arbitration will be subject to different rules
          than the rules that would apply in court, and court review of
          arbitration awards is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award
          on an individual basis the same damages and other relief as a court
          (including injunctive and declaratory relief and statutory damages),
          and must follow these Terms of Service, as a court would.

          individual, and not on a class-wide, basis, and an arbitrator shall
          have no authority to certify a class or award class-wide relief. The
          arbitrator is authorized only to award relief on behalf of the
          individual parties and only to their extent of their individual
          claims. You acknowledge and agree that unless otherwise agreed in
          writing by you and One Project, with regard to any claims hereunder,
          you may not seek to, and an arbitrator or court may not, join or
          consolidate your claims with any other similar claims. You agree you
          will not proceed in any court or arbitration proceedings as a
          representative of others (including in the capacity of a private
          attorney general), join in any court or arbitration proceedings
          brought by any other person, and understand that you may not be
          included as a member of any class that may be certified by a court or
          arbitrator. Your waiver of your rights to bring or participate in
          court proceedings and as a representative or member of a class applies
          specifically, but is not limited to, claims brought under California's
          Unfair Competition Law, False Advertising Act and its Consumer Legal
          Remedies Act, Ohio's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and any
          other state consumer protection laws.

          28.3 Notice Requirements
        </Header3>
        <p>
          Before commencing any arbitration proceedings under these Terms of
          Service, a party must first send to the other a written notice of
          dispute ("Notice"). Your Notice to One Project must be sent to the
          address stated in Section 28 below. If a party's claim is not resolved
          within sixty (60) days of delivery of the applicable Notice, you or we
          may commence arbitration proceedings in accordance with these Terms of
          Service.

          28.4 Arbitration Procedures
        </Header3>
        <p>
          The arbitration of any claim or dispute hereunder (including whether a
          valid arbitration agreement exists and whether it covers the dispute)
          shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator administered by
          JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted pursuant to the
          then-current Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (available
          at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and, if you
          are an individual, in accordance with JAMS' Consumer Arbitration
          Minimum Standards (available at
          https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/) (as applicable,
          the "JAMS Rules"). If the JAMS Rules conflict with any portion of
          these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service shall control. You and
          One Project shall mutually agree on a neutral arbitrator, provided
          that if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within ten (10)
          days, then JAMS will choose the arbitrator. The arbitration of any
          claims or disputes hereunder shall be conducted in San Francisco,
          California, except that if you are an individual the arbitration may
          be conducted in the county or parish of your primary residence. You or
          we also may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone,
          based on written submissions, or in person at another mutually agreed
          location. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
          will be governed by the JAMS Rules.

          28.5 Applicable Law and Awards
        </Header3>
        <p>
          The arbitrator shall apply the law of the State of California as
          stated above, except that the interpretation and enforcement of this
          arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
          Act. The arbitrator shall be empowered to award the prevailing party
          any remedy available at law or in equity not specifically precluded by
          these Terms of Service, including without limitation injunctive or
          declaratory relief, specific performance, and damages. The
          arbitrator's award will consist of a written statement stating the
          disposition of each claim. The award also will provide a concise
          written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which
          the award is based. Each party shall pay its own fees and costs of its
          own attorneys, experts and witnesses incurred in connection with any
          arbitration or court proceeding between the parties, notwithstanding
          any provision awarding attorneys' fees to a prevailing party that may
          be a part of any statute under which you or we may bring a claim. The
          award of the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment in any court of
          competent jurisdiction.

          You may opt-out of Sections 27(a)-(e) by sending a notice ("Rejection

          28.8 Non-Arbitrable Claims
        </Header3>
        <p>
          To the extent that a dispute is not subject to arbitration under this
          Section 27, such dispute must be resolved exclusively through an
          action brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in
          San Francisco, California and both parties irrevocably consent to the
          jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the adjudication of any
          non-arbitrable claims and waive any objection to such courts on any
          basis, including without limitation inconvenience of the forum. You
