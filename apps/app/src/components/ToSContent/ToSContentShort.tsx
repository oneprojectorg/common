        <Header3 className="font-serif">1. Who We Are</Header3>
        <p>
          Common is a digital platform that connects people, organizations, and
          resources to coordinate and grow economic democracy to global scale.
          The Common platform is run by One Project. One Project is a nonprofit
          building infrastructure for a new economy, where resources serve
          people and planet, not profit. We partner with the rising global
          movement for economic democracy to build core technology, mobilize
          catalytic resources, and show the world that a better system is
          possible today.

        <p>
          When creating your account, provide accurate information and keep your
          password secure. Don't use fake details or pretend to be someone else.

        <Header3 className="font-serif">5. Our Code of Conduct</Header3>
        <p>
          All users of the Platform must comply with our Code of Conduct,
          including these core community principles:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Treat Everyone with Respect and Consideration</strong>{' '}
          (adopted from DisCO Caring Community Guidelines): Be kind,
          understanding, and compassionate to each other. Be welcoming. Be aware
          of how we use language. This is especially important when discussing
          sensitive topics where misunderstandings and stereotypes can be
          exacerbated. Remember we're here to support, learn, and collaborate
          with each other to grow a democratic economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be Respectful of Privacy:</strong> Respect the privacy and
          confidentiality of others. If there are sensitive partnerships, obtain
          permission before making them visible on the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Build Robust Relationships:</strong> Build strong, resilient
          connections that strengthen collaboration, deepen existing
          partnerships, and enable new relationships to emerge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inclusive Network Development:</strong> Wherever possible, try
          to amplify the voice and needs of smaller local organizations that may
          initially have limited connections as they start to engage new
          collaborations on the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Center Affected Communities</strong> (adopted from New Economy
          Coalition Agreements): Recognize and respect the expertise,
          leadership, and lived experiences of communities most impacted by
          economic inequality. Actively make space for their voices, defer to
          their guidance on issues affecting them directly, and acknowledge
          their essential role in developing meaningful solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Share from Your Own Experiences</strong> (adopted from New
          Economy Coalition Agreements): Be sure to share information and
          perspectives from your experiences rather than making assumptions
          about or speaking on behalf of others. When sharing information,
          clearly distinguish among personal knowledge, organizational
          position/perspective, and third-party information.

          content people post on the platform - that content has different
          rules. We can change the license terms if needed, but we'll always
          post updates publicly.
