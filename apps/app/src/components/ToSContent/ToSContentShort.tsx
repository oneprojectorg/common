        <Header3 className="font-serif">Our Code of Conduct</Header3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          All users of the Platform must comply with our Code of Conduct,
          including these core community principles:
        </p>
        <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Treat Everyone with Respect and Consideration</strong>{' '}
            (adopted from DisCO Caring Community Guidelines): Be kind,
            understanding, and compassionate to each other. Be welcoming. Be
            aware of how we use language. This is especially important when
            discussing sensitive topics where misunderstandings and stereotypes
            can be exacerbated. Remember we're here to support, learn, and
            collaborate with each other to grow a democratic economy.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Be Respectful of Privacy:</strong> Respect the privacy and
            confidentiality of others. If there are sensitive partnerships,
            obtain permission before making them visible on the Platform.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Build Robust Relationships:</strong> Build strong, resilient
            connections that strengthen collaboration, deepen existing
            partnerships, and enable new relationships to emerge.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Inclusive Network Development:</strong> Wherever possible,
            try to amplify the voice and needs of smaller local organizations
            that may initially have limited connections as they start to engage
            new collaborations on the Platform.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Center Affected Communities</strong> (adopted from New
            Economy Coalition Agreements): Recognize and respect the expertise,
            leadership, and lived experiences of communities most impacted by
            economic inequality. Actively make space for their voices, defer to
            their guidance on issues affecting them directly, and acknowledge
            their essential role in developing meaningful solutions.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            <strong>Share from Your Own Experiences</strong> (adopted from New
            Economy Coalition Agreements): Be sure to share information and
            perspectives from your experiences rather than making assumptions
            about or speaking on behalf of others. When sharing information,
            clearly distinguish among personal knowledge, organizational
            position/perspective, and third-party information.
