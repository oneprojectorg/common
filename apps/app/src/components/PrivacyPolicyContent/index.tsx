          One Project (collectively One Project, we, our, or us) is a non-profit
          building infrastructure for a new economy where resources serve people
          and planet, not profit. We partner with the rising global movement for
          economic democracy to build core technology, mobilize catalytic
          resources, and show the world that a better system is possible. We
          value your privacy and the protection of your Personal Data. This
          Privacy Notice (Notice) explains how we collect, store, use, share,
          transfer, delete, and otherwise process information collected from or
          about you known as Personal Data (defined further below in this
          Notice). As an entity with international operations, One Project
          provides services to users in different countries, and we process

          2. Purpose of this Privacy Notice
        </Header3>
        <p>
          This Notice describes the types of Personal Data that One Project may
          collect or process, how we may use and disclose that Personal Data,
          how you may exercise any rights you may have regarding our processing
          of your Personal Data, and how you can contact us if you would like to
          exercise them or if you have any questions or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Notice applies to Personal Data collected or processed by us
          through the Common Platform (Platform or Services). One Project may
          provide you with a different privacy notice in certain specific
          situations, in which case that privacy notice or policy will apply to
          the Personal Data collected or processed in that specific situation,
          rather than this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you provide us with Personal Data related to anyone other than
          yourself, please note that you are responsible for complying with all
          privacy and data protection laws prior to providing that information
          to One Project (including collecting consent, if required).
        </p>
        <p>
          Please review this Notice carefully. To the extent permitted by law,
          by providing us your Personal Data or otherwise interacting with us,
          you are agreeing to this Notice and consent to the personal data
          processing described in this notice. If you do not agree with our
          policies and practices, it is your choice not to use our Services or
          otherwise engage with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Notice is designed with the nonprofit context in mind. We process
          Personal Data to support our mission and deliver related services, not
          for commercial profit. All of the information we collect is in service
          of running the platform and we aim to collect data for the explicit
          purpose of running the platform.

          3.1 What is Personal Data?
        </Header3>
        <p>
          Personal Data is any information—as electronically or otherwise
          recorded—that can be used to identify a person or that we can link to
          or associate with a specific individual, such as a name, address,
          email address, or telephone number. Personal Data in some countries
          can include information that indirectly identifies a person, even
          absent other identifying information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal Data may include information considered sensitive in some
          jurisdictions, such as biometric information, genetic information,
          health information, financial account information, specific
          geolocation, ethnic or racial origin, information concerning your sex
          life or your sexual orientation, social security number, driver's
          license number, state identification card number, passport number, and
          other similar information. Personal Data that could be considered
          sensitive Personal Data under any law is indicated with a caret (^) in
          the chart below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will process any Personal Data we collect in accordance with law
          and as described in this Notice (unless, as explained above, a
          separate policy or notice governs). In some circumstances, if you do
          not provide us with certain Personal Data, there may be some Services
          that are unavailable to you.

          3.2 Types of Personal Data We Collect

        <p>
          The below table is a high-level summary of the types of Personal Data
          we may collect from you. Following that high-level summary is
          additional detail and information on how we collect, process, and use
          Personal Data and the potential recipients of your Personal Data, now
          and in the preceding 12 months. Some jurisdictions require us to state
          the legal bases for processing your Personal Data, which are the
          legally recognized reasons for processing your Personal Data, but
          please note that not all jurisdictions recognize all legal bases. The
          types of Personal Data we collect and disclose depends on your
          relationship with One Project. Not all of the categories listed in the
          following charts may apply to you. If the nature of your relationship
          with One Project changes, additional categories of Personal Data may
          also apply. One Project does not use or disclose Personal Data or
          sensitive Personal Data other than for the purposes specified herein.

          We generally retain Personal Data for as long as needed for the

          de-identify or anonymize your Personal Data or otherwise remove some
          or all information that may identify you from records that we may need
          to keep for periods beyond the specified retention period. The
          criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the
          length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you; (ii) whether
          there is a legal obligation to which we are subject that affects the
          length of time we need to keep your Personal Data; and (iii) whether
          retention is determined to be necessary for One Project due to
          limitation periods, litigation, or other legal or regulatory
          obligations. One Project takes reasonable steps to securely dispose of
          Personal Data upon the expiration of retention periods, taking into
          consideration these litigation, legal, or regulatory obligations.
