Can you review the tests on this branch? Make sure they are testing the things they say they are testing and that there are no redundant tests. Also make sure that if we check for errors that we check for the error code or name more specifically. They should be properly isolated and able to run concurrently. Please reference the tests README for more info on how tests are properly created.
